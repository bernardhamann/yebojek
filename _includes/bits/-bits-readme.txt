Widgits is how you can add different functions to your website.

Use widgets for many things such as
- contact forms
- facebook like buttons
- etc

Widgets are similar to bits, but widgets are different in that they are more for display. Bits are more for generl pieces of code you might want to place into your website. Widgets are more for your sites custom functions. Bits are more for general functions included in the Yebojek features.

Look at the Bits templates and instuctions folder to see what features you can add your you Yebojek website.

If unsure, just use a widget.
